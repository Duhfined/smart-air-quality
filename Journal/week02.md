# Goals
- Research more and learn about the effects of air quality
- Get a working web server on the ESP32 (Or research other methods)
## Issues
## Notes
- For future reference, I will most likely have to learn the basics of HTML to edit a web server.
- As of currently, I am just using a placeholder for the html and intend to learn how to edit myself
- Google Sheets is also a way of recording data
- Currently, I am running a web server on the ESP itself. The esp cannot handle days or hours of data.
- I am looking into getting a database to let the ESP32 to send the data to. (InfluxDB)
## Future Steps
- Learn HTML when needed 
## Code
