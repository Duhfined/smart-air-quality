## Observations
This file documents online research and analysis of real-life data.

# Optimal Air Conditions
- People spend up to 90% of their time indoors.
- According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, it is recommended to have a humidity of **30%-50%.**
- Bad air quality can increase the chances and likelihood of asthma or allergy reactions, along with airway irritants.
- A list provided below (From AAFA) includes the possible harmful particles in the air
    - Allergens
    - Mold
    - Chemicals, scents, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
    - Smoke and fumes
    - Certain gases like ozone, radon, and carbon monoxide
    - Outdoor air pollution that gets trapped inside buildings
# Importance of Ventilation
- When air is not circulated or refreshed, polluted indoor air stays contaminated. Additionally, humidity is likely to increase as a result.
- When air is ventilated, fresh air is brought indoors while indoor pollution moves outside.
  
# Temperature and Humidity Sensors
- An old Arduino Forum covered the different types of temperature sensors available.
- I found out that there are better modules than the DHT11 and DHT22, which are not top-tier for accurate measurements.
